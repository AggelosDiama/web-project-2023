# CEID - WEB PROJECT 2023

This is a class project of the course Programming and Systems in Worldwide Web of the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department (CEID) of University of Patras. It was implemented by **Aggelos Diamantopoulos** (Front-end part) and **Fotis Paraskevopoulos** (Back-end part).

## Goal of Application
The aim of this project is to develop a collaborative system for registration, search and evaluation of super-market consumer goods offers between users. The system allows its registered users to inform others about the availability of products that are at a good (according to their own criteria) price, working in parallel with existing tools (such as e-katanalotis), which are only updated in terms of price but not stock, but also do not include all super-market stores (e.g. local chains, mini-markets).

It is up to other users to check the validity of the offers, who can either validate the offer (like) or indicate that it is not valid (dislike) or that the product is out of stock (out-of-stock). Users can also indicate that an offer has ended. To encourage participation, the system rewards users who offer information with 'points'.

## Problem Solved by the Application
Regular consumers want to buy quality products and their lowest value (value for money) and often itâ€™s difficult to compare prices among all the available markets and a short amount of time. With Make.DisCount the user can easily find markets nearby, check their discounts on products and decide in a timely manner where to buy what. Moreover, they can create a community of users where they will evaluate the discounts and in that way, they will highlight certain products if their discount is worth it or not. 

## UX Research
Before starting the design and development of the web app we conducting a short but valuable User Experience research where we defined the main points of the app and searched similar apps on how they designed around a map element. The report of the research can be found **[here]([url](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JeKEP3GgZApipUp8u3QFViwdH21vnyexxryihFJpS4I/edit?usp=sharing))**.
